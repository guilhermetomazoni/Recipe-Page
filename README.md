## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
It was a nice way to get a hands-on the html structure. Understanding how each content will affect the following or parent element. It was also an opportunity to explore the responsive designs for mobile devices, customization for bullet lists and tables. Also, it was an opportunity to get hands on to the @font-face.


### Continued development

For the development, I'll keep exploring responsive designs, the ::before attribute, hsl color and best practices for CSS.
